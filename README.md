## Joel's changes
new variables lpuryear2, lp6_bin, recency_numeric, recency_factor (use in regression). Don't use variables dm_ad, dm_lp, recency, lpuryear, datelp6.
datead6 is unfixed for now (since I think it will be insignificant). If it ends up being significant, I'll change it.
Also: use ordtyr2 and ordlyr2 instead of ordtyr and ordlyr
